Maruti Suzuki Baleno expert review

Expert Quote
------------
“Despite the improvements and feature additions, it only costs slightly more than the outgoing model, which makes it an exceptional value proposition.”

Exterior
--------
Within the sub-4m footprint, the Maruti Baleno is one of the most stylish hatchbacks. Despite being launched in 2022, the front looks fresh and elegant, and its LED projector headlamps look premium. I like the sharp headlights that get tri-LED DRLs and the tasteful use of chrome accents all around looks really nice. The styling is rather simple in profile with a typical hatchback-like silhouette and minimal cuts and creases. Higher variants sport 16-inch dual-tone alloys, but lower variants get 16-inch steel wheels with and without covers. I like what Maruti has done with the rear of the Baleno, which looks premium with its C-shaped tail lamps boasting the same tri-LED elements as the front. While it does get a roof-mounted spoiler, I wish Maruti offered the Baleno with a shark fin antenna to make it a little sportier. The 2025 Maruti Baleno gets 7 monotone exterior colours: Nexa Blue, Grandeur Grey, Arctic White, Splendid Silver, Opulent Red, Luxe Beige, Bluish Black.

Interior
--------
Design & Quality The Maruti Baleno gets a rather busy looking cabin with multiple layers on the dashboard and a dual-tone black and blue theme. The quality of the cabin is acceptable for the price, with the dashboard draped in plastics finished in different textures. Maruti has made sure to wrap all the major touchpoints like front armrests (central and door) and steering wheel in soft touch leatherette material, which make the cabin feel rich. I like the silver accents around the AC vents, on the AC control buttons/switches and steering wheel, which add a premium touch to the design. While it’s not a glaring issue, I wish Maruti offered different steering mounted controls and window switches, as the quality feels lower compared to the rest of the cabin. Driving Position With a good amount of cushioning and space on offer, the Baleno’s front seats are comfortable for average-sized people. However, the side supports are too soft and don’t offer adequate support to wider people. Finding a comfortable driving position is super easy with the tilt and telescopic adjustable steering wheel and the height-adjustable driver's seat (from Zeta variant). There are no issues with the visibility from the driver’s seat. Passenger comfort With soft cushioning for the rear seats, the Baleno feels comfortable on short drives. But it might result in a bit of discomfort over long journeys. Rear seat space is adequate with more than enough knee-room, acceptable headroom (for up to 6ft people) and room to stretch your legs out in the front. The rear seats can accommodate three average sized passengers, but the middle passenger sits a little upright due to the backrest protruding outwards. A middle headrest is also missing here. I really wish Maruti offered the Baleno with rear central armrest for improved comfort, because it otherwise is a really pleasant cabin for four people. Storage Options The Baleno gets 1-litre bottles pockets in all four doors, a sun visor, two cupholders in the central console with space ahead to keep your phone or keys. The central armrest hides a storage space underneath and the glovebox gets an adequate stowage area. There’s also a tray on the right of the steering wheel to store loose receipts. Rear seat occupants get storage in the seat back pockets and a small slot underneath the rear AC vent to keep your phone. Features The 2025 Maruti Baleno doesn’t leave anything in terms of the equipment on offer with the feature list packing cruise control, automatic AC with rear AC vents, auto dimming inside mirror, auto folding outside mirrors, connected car technology, and fast charging type-C ports. The 9-inch infotainment is easy and smooth to operate with a crisp and clear resolution. Only the user interface feels a bit dated now. Wireless Android Auto and AppleCarPlay are easy to connect and use. The 6-speaker sound system offers a decent audio experience for the price, and also gets preset equalizer settings. I like that Maruti has offered the request sensor for the keyless entry on both the driver and passenger side door. Very convenient. While it doesn’t get a full-fledged modern-day digital driver’s display, the Baleno does get a segment-exclusive head-up display, which relays information like speed and RPM readout.

Safety
------
The Maruti Baleno’s standard list of safety features include dual airbags, ISOFIX mounts, electronic stability program, hill hold control, and reversing parking sensors. The higher variants add equipment like six airbags (from Zeta variant) and 360-degree camera (top-spec only) to the list. This version of the Maruti Baleno hasn’t been tested by any crash test agency yet.

Boot Space
----------
2025 Maruti Baleno has an on-paper boot capacity of 318 litres. Its boot is big enough to accommodate a full size suitcase. It’s also deep so you can stack a medium suitcase above it easily and still have space towards the side for a cabin trolley. The rear seats get 60:40 split (from Delta variant), which can be folded down if you want to haul larger items. However, it has a high loading lip, which requires additional effort to store luggage, especially the heavier bags.

Performance
-----------
The 2025 Maruti Baleno only gets a single 1.2-litre, four-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine, which is available with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed AMT. The engine can also be paired with a CNG kit, but only with a manual transmission. Specifications 1.2-litre NA petrol 1.2-litre NA petrol + CNG Power 90 PS 77.5 PS Torque 113 Nm 98.5 Nm Transmissions 5-speed MT/5-speed AMT 5-speed MT Fuel efficiency (Claimed) 22.35 kmpl (MT) | 22.94 kmpl (AMT) 30.61 km/kg 1.2-litre petrol The Baleno’s petrol engine is a refined unit, which won’t trouble you with any noise and vibrations. In fact, some people might appreciate the sound of the engine under hard acceleration, which feels a little sporty. The engine is responsive, and picks up speeds from lower RPMs without any hesitation. Acceleration isn’t strong or exciting, but it's smooth and linear — good enough for all your daily city commutes. With a light clutch weight and satisfying gear throw, the manual transmission is our recommended choice for the Baleno, especially if you appreciate a good manual and want more control. The automatic transmission (AMT) is smooth when driven in a relaxed manner. But ask for anything more and it will feel slow and jerky. High speed overtakes will require you to be in the right gear in the automatic transmission (AMT) as it does take some time to react when you ask for a quick overtake. I would only recommend you to opt for the Baleno’s AMT if your usage involves very heavy stop-and-go traffic and you need an automatic’s convenience there. 1.2-litre petrol+CNG Even with the drop in overall power and torque output, performance of the Baleno CNG feels adequate for in-city drives. It cruises comfortably at speeds of 80-100kmph, and you will only feel the difference in performance in reaching or in making an overtake at those speeds. You can opt for the Baleno CNG if you have a really high running, as this is the most efficient version with a claimed fuel economy of 30.61km/kg.

Ride and Handling
-----------------
I really like how the Baleno feels comfortable on really bad roads and also feels confident around a corner. Over bad roads, potholes, and speedbreakers, the Baleno absorbs the bumps well and the movement inside the cabin is kept to a minimum. Sharper potholes or unusually large speedbreakers will require you to slow down because the suspension tends to run out of its range of motion if the speed is higher than usual. Highway high speed stability is appreciable and it remains stable over an undulation or highway expansion joint. Despite the Baleno’s super easy-to-drive nature in the city, it still feels stable and confident around a fast corner and you won’t have any complaints driving it in hilly regions.

Variants
--------
Maruti offers the Baleno in four variants: Sigma, Delta, Zeta and Alpha. The Baleno’s CNG kit is available in the mid-spec Delta and Zeta variants. Maruti Baleno Sigma Bare bone variant gets LED elements only in the tail lights. Sports halogen projector headlights, 16-inch steel wheels, and body coloured bumpers. Functional features include auto AC, power windows, keyless entry, and tilt steering adjustment. No touchscreen or sound system. The driver gets a black and white multi-info display. Standard safety kit includes dual airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX mounts, and reverse parking sensors. Maruti Baleno Delta Better exterior looks with chrome inserts, wheel covers, and body coloured door handles. Improved functional features with electric outside mirrors, steering mounted controls, and rear parcel shelf. Adds 7-inch touchscreen with wired Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and 4-speakers. Maruti Baleno Zeta More premium feel with painted alloys, LED headlights, and additional chrome garnishes all around. Top feature additions include rear AC vents, USB type-A and C charging ports, push button start/stop and connected car features. Improved functionality with driver seat height and telescopic steering adjustment and front central armrest. Gets wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and 6-speaker sound system. Adds 6 airbags and rear view camera. Maruti Baleno Alpha Full premium feel with full LED lighting setup including DRLs and fog lamps, 16-inch machined alloy wheels, and UV cut glasses. Functional add ons include 360-degree camera, cruise control, auto dimming inside mirror, auto folding outside mirror, and vanity lamps (driver and passenger). Features a 9-inch infotainment system with a head-up display for the driver. CarDekho recommends: The base variant of the Maruti Baleno is too basic. If you’re on a budget, we would recommend the one-above-base Delta variant, which offers many functional features along with a basic entertainment package. The Baleno’s Zeta variant feels the most value for money as it doesn’t miss on any functional or even comfort feature for you to complain about.

Verdict
-------
The Maruti Baleno is a good example of why Maruti is the top car manufacturer in India. It might not have the same glamour or sportier iterations like some of its rivals do, but as far as a family hatchback goes – the basic formula is nearly perfect with qualities like space, comfort, practicality, features, and refinement.
